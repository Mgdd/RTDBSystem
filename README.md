Real-Time database system algorithms semulation

this program is composed of 5 real-time database system algorithms, the algorithms are listed below: 
a-	Wait techniques  with earliest deadline first for resovling the conflict
b-	Wait Promote techniques with earliest deadline first for resovling the conflict
c-	High Priority techniques  with earliest deadline first for resovling the conflict
d-	Conditional Restart techniques  with earliest deadline first for resovling the conflict
e-	Proposed model: it called Conditional Waiting High Priority technieque (CWHP) to resolve the conflict.
          
proposed model called :Conditional Waiting High Priority technieque (CWHP) to resolve the conflict , we take the below data for example

transaction:A |	Arrival time(r):0 |	Execution time(E):2 |	Deadline(d):7.5 |	updates:X

transaction:B |	Arrival time(r):1 |	Execution time(E):2 |	Deadline(d):4 |	updates:X

transaction:C |	Arrival time(r):2 |	Execution time(E):3 |	Deadline(d):7 |	updates:Y

-	Transaction A  is the only job in the time 0, it gains the processor and executes until time 1 when transaction B arrives
-	T(B)  during this time it request and gain an exclusive lock on data object X since T(B) has an earlier line than T(A)
-	T(B)  prempts T(A)  and begin to execute 
-	At time 1.5 T(B) attempts to lock data object X which already locked by T(A)
-	Under Wait strategy T(B) must wait untill T(A) is finishes 
-	Our proposed algorithm Conditional Waiting High Priority technieque (CWHP) counted the remaining time of  execuion time of T(A) using these Formula:
RET(A) = ET(A) - ∆ET(A)

RET(A) : is the remaining executin time for T(A)  which holding the lock on data object X

ET(A) : execusion estemated time for T(A)

∆ET(A) : is the amount by serves already T(A) recieved

In our example:

RT(A) = 2-1 =1

The deadline of transaction B calculated by formula

DT(B)= AT(B)+RET(A)+E(B) 

DT(B): deadline of transaction B

AT(B) : Arrival time of transaction B

RET(A): the remaing time for execution transaction A

E(B) : execusion time of transaction B

DT(B)  = 1+1+2= 4

S(B) = DB-EB

S(B) =4-2= 2

ST(B) : is how long transaction execution can be delayed while still making it possible to meet the transaction deadline

-	The CWHP compare the remaining execution time of  A RET(A) with  slack time of S(B)
-	if  RET(A)  ≤ S(B)
-	T(B) blocked until  transaction T(A) release the lock on dada object X.
-	T(A)  resumes execution and completes its computation at time 2 , when it commits it releases the lock  on item X, thus T(B)  is unblocked and it finish its computation at time 4
-	T(C)  enter the system at time 2 and start the execution at time 4 and finish at time 7
-	The over all schedule length is 7
-	By using new propsed CWHP all transactiom meet there deadline
